# ComicTube
<hr>
The goal of this design is to invoke that little kid in everyone, that excited, might I say - comical, innocent child who's just into their things and loves them. 


I started from a few colors from colorhunt.co, which was super useful. I initially was going to try and redesign Reddit's app, but it all formed into this thing. 

After getting some colors I approved of, I continued on with the fonts. I think the mixture of the Banger as well as Montserrat make for a good combination that attempts to invoke a childish and silly feeling.
